# .NET Dependency Injection: IServiceCollection, IServiceProvider, Key-Typed Services, and IEnumerable Services

This document explains key concepts in .NET Dependency Injection (DI).

## Key Concepts

*   **IServiceCollection:**
    *   A container for registering services and their lifetimes (Singleton, Scoped, Transient).
    *   A collection of service descriptors defining how services are resolved.
*   **IServiceProvider:**
    *   The resolver in the DI system.
    *   Used to retrieve services registered in IServiceCollection.
*   **Key-Typed Services:**
    *   Allows registering multiple implementations of the same service interface, differentiated by a key.
    *   Useful for different behaviors from the same interface.
*   **IEnumerable<T> Services:**
    *   Allows injecting all registered implementations of a service.
    *   Useful for aggregating multiple implementations.

## How They Fit Together

1.  **Register Services:** Use IServiceCollection to register dependencies.
2.  **Build Provider:** The DI container generates an IServiceProvider.
3.  **Resolve Dependencies:** Use IServiceProvider (or constructor injection) to resolve services.
4.  **Handle Multiple Implementations:**
    *   Use Key-Typed Services for differentiated behaviors.
    *   Use IEnumerable<T> for aggregating all implementations.

## Benefits of DI

*   Cleaner, more testable, and maintainable applications.
*   Structuring dependencies effectively.
*   Supporting multiple implementations and usage patterns.
