## "Shi Shan" Code Style Guide

Here are the key characteristics of "Shi Shan" code style detailed in the video:

*   **No Comments:**  The code is deliberately written without any comments, making it incredibly difficult for anyone else (or even the original author in the future) to understand the purpose and logic of the code. This ensures maximum confusion and frustration for anyone who has to work with it.

*   **Arbitrary Variable Naming:** Variable names are chosen randomly and without any meaning. Examples include using single-letter names like `i`, `j`, `k`, meaningless pinyin abbreviations, or even naming variables after girlfriends or pets. This makes it impossible to infer the variable's purpose from its name.

*   **Extremely Long Functions:** Functions are excessively long, containing thousands of lines of code.  This monolithic structure makes the code incredibly hard to read, debug, and maintain.  The sheer size of the functions becomes overwhelming.

*   **Duplicated Code:** Instead of writing reusable functions, the "Shi Shan" style encourages massive amounts of copy-pasted code. This leads to redundancy, increased code size, and makes bug fixing a nightmare as changes need to be applied to multiple identical blocks of code.

*   **Outdated Technology:** The video specifically mocks the use of outdated technologies like jQuery, sarcastically praising it as "still going strong."  This highlights the "Shi Shan" tendency to cling to obsolete tools and frameworks, ignoring modern and more efficient alternatives.

*   **No Tests:**  "Shi Shan" code is written without any unit tests or automated testing. This means the quality of the code is completely unverified, and regressions are likely to be introduced with every change.  There's no safety net to catch errors.

*   **Inconsistent Code Style:**  The entire project lacks a consistent code style. Formatting is haphazard, indentation is inconsistent, and there are no coding conventions followed. This makes the codebase visually jarring and even harder to parse.

*   **Meaningless Commit Messages:**  When committing code changes, the commit messages are utterly unhelpful, such as "fix bug" or "update." These messages provide no context or explanation of what was actually changed or why.

*   **Environment Dependency:** The code is written in a way that it only works in a very specific, often undocumented, environment.  Moving the code to a different environment will likely cause it to break, creating deployment and portability issues.

*   **Magic Numbers:**  The code is riddled with "magic numbers" - unexplained numerical constants directly embedded in the code without any named constants or clear explanation of their meaning. This makes the code opaque and difficult to understand or modify.

*   **Global Variables Everywhere:**  "Shi Shan" style heavily relies on global variables. This increases code complexity, creates unintended side effects, and makes it very hard to reason about the program's state.

*   **Poor Error Handling:** Error handling is either rudimentary or completely absent.  Exceptions are often ignored or handled in a very generic and unhelpful way, making debugging and fault tolerance extremely difficult.

*   **Missing Documentation:**  Unsurprisingly, "Shi Shan" code comes with absolutely no documentation. There are no explanations of how the code works, how to use it, or what its purpose is.  Anyone trying to understand the code is left completely in the dark.
